## Context

Architecture decisions are critical for documenting the evolution of our system.

## Decision

We will record architecture decisions using Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## Consequences

1. All major architectural decisions will be documented.
2. Decisions will be version-controlled for traceability.
3. Engineers will reference ADRs to ensure alignment.
